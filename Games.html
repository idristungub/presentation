          Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to
          perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game.
          Unlike most of its peers at the time, Half-Life uses scripted
          sequences, such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door, to advance major
          plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which
          relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines,
          Half-Life's story is told mostly using scripted sequences (bar one
          short cutscene), keeping the player in control of the first-person
          viewpoint. In line with this, the player rarely loses the ability to
          control the player character, who never speaks and is never actually
          seen in the game; the player sees "through his eyes" for the entire
          length of the game. Half-Life has no "levels"; it instead divides the
          game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player
          moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous,
          except for short pauses for loading.

          League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
          multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
          Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
          Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
          the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
          free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
          customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
